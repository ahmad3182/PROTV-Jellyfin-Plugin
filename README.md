# PROTV for Jellyfin

Watch your PROTV channels, films and series inside Jellyfin, with a program guide, a management
dashboard, search, parental locks and a PROTV tab on the Jellyfin home page.

> [!WARNING]
> **Early development. Not a final version.** The plugin changes parts of your Jellyfin
> configuration (see [What the plugin modifies](#what-the-plugin-modifies)) and can misbehave.
> **Back up your Jellyfin configuration and data before installing it.** Use it at your own risk.
>
> **Made with AI.** This plugin was developed with the help of AI (Claude, by Anthropic). AI-written
> code can contain mistakes, and it has only had limited testing on real servers.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Subscription** | A valid, active PROTV account. The plugin includes no channels, accounts or content. |
| **Location** | **Works in Syria only.** The PROTV service is only available there. |
| **Network** | The server must reach the PROTV service (default `http://10.1.0.8:82`) and receive its multicast streams (UDP `225.2.0.x`, port `1234`). |
| **Jellyfin** | **12.x** (built against the Jellyfin 12.0.0 plugin packages, .NET 10). It does not load on 10.x or 11.x. |
| **Companion plugins** | Plugin Pages, File Transformation and Custom Tabs (see below). |

## Required companion plugins

PROTV draws its dashboard entry and its home page tab through three plugins by **IAmParadox27**. By
default **PROTV switches itself off (no tuner, no guide, no pages) when one of them is missing.**

| Plugin | Author | Repository | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| File Transformation | IAmParadox27 | [jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation) | Web client patches the other two need |
| Plugin Pages | IAmParadox27 | [jellyfin-plugin-pages](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-pages) | The PROTV entry in the sidebar |
| Custom Tabs | IAmParadox27 | [jellyfin-plugin-custom-tabs](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-custom-tabs) | The PROTV tab on the home page |

Install them first: **Dashboard > Plugins > Repositories > Add**
`https://www.iamparadox.dev/jellyfin/plugins/manifest.json`, then install File Transformation, Plugin
Pages and Custom Tabs from the **Catalog**, in that order, and restart Jellyfin. If one is not in the
catalog, follow the install instructions in its repository.

The switch is the `RequireCompanionPlugins` setting (default `true`). Turn it off only when you want
Live TV without the sidebar entry and home page tab.

## Installation

### From the plugin catalog

1. **Dashboard > Plugins > Repositories > Add** and enter:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/manifest.json`
2. Open the **Catalog**, install **PROTV**, and restart Jellyfin.

### By hand

1. Download `PROTV_<version>.zip` from the [releases](../../releases) and extract `PROTV.Plugin.dll`.
2. Put it in `<config>/plugins/PROTV/` (Docker image: `/config/plugins/PROTV/`; Windows:
   `%ProgramData%\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\PROTV\`). Make sure the Jellyfin user can read it.
3. Restart Jellyfin.

### Docker

PROTV streams use multicast, which does not cross Docker's default bridge network. Use host networking:

```yaml
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin:12.0   # a pinned 12.x tag
    network_mode: host              # required for multicast
```

Wired connections are strongly recommended: multicast over Wi-Fi is unreliable. With several network
cards, set the **Multicast network interface** on the dashboard.

## Getting started

1. Open **PROTV** in the Jellyfin sidebar (or **Dashboard > PROTV**).
2. Enter your PROTV **username and password**, press **Test connection**, then **Save**.
3. **Dashboard > Live TV > Tuner Devices**: add the **PROTV** tuner. Under **TV Guide Data Providers**
   add **PROTV EPG** if you want program data.
4. Press **Refresh guide now** on the PROTV page. Your channels appear in Live TV.
5. Watch from **Live TV**, or open the **PROTV** tab on the home page and tap a channel.

The password box is deliberately empty after saving: the password is encrypted on the server, and a
blank box means "keep the saved one". Type a new password only when you want to replace it.

## Features

**Live TV**

- PROTV tuner with channel logos and a built-in channel-to-stream table.
- Program guide through the **PROTV EPG** provider.
- An **On now** row and now / next lines on the home page tab.
- **Channel health check:** probes each stream every six hours (and on demand) and greys out a channel
  the last check could not get data for. The result is kept in memory; it never changes your settings.
- **Favourites and groups:** mark channels as favourites and put them in named groups (News, Sports,
  Kids, …). The tab shows Favourites first, then the groups in your order, then the remaining channels.
- **Parental locks:** tick **Locked** on chosen channels, set a PIN, and the tab asks for it before
  playing those channels. Each Jellyfin user unlocks their own session for twelve hours.
- Several viewers can watch the same channel at once; a clear "channel not working" error when a
  channel has no stream address.

**Films and series (VOD)**

- Two libraries the plugin creates and keeps up to date: **PROTV VOD** (films) and **PROTV VOD Series**.
- Every title is a small `.strm` file plus `.nfo` metadata, poster and subtitles, so it plays like any
  other library on web, mobile and TV apps.
- **Genres:** the sync asks PROTV for a title's categories and writes them into `movie.nfo` /
  `tvshow.nfo`, so Jellyfin's genre filters and collections work. Existing NFOs that have no
  `<genre>` are repaired one by one on the next sync; the rest of the library is not rewritten.
- **Sync status on the dashboard:** last run, film / series / episode / subtitle counts, disk used,
  download budget and the last error, plus a **Sync now** button that shows live counters.
- The scheduled task **Sync PROTV VOD library** (category PROTV) runs on an interval.
- A disk budget for posters and subtitles, and the sync steps aside while somebody is watching.
- Titles PROTV no longer lists are removed only after a complete sync that listed at least half of
  what the previous complete run saw (can be switched off). A short or failed answer never empties
  the library.
- **Search across live channels, films and series** in one box in the **All** view of the tab.

**Dashboard**

- Account, service address and device name, with a **Test connection** button. A blank password reuses
  the saved one only when the username still matches.
- **Channels:** rename, hide, reorder or change the logo of any channel; mark favourites, assign
  groups and lock channels.
- **Channel groups:** add, rename, reorder and delete groups. Group names are shown exactly as typed.
- **Appearance:** page heading, welcome message, menu label, icon and interface language.
- **Device and streaming:** device IP / MAC, router MAC, multicast network interface, stream analysis
  time.
- **Home page tab** and **VOD** settings.
- **Settings backup and restore:** downloads or restores a JSON file with the visible settings,
  channel overrides and groups. Passwords and stream-signing secrets are deliberately left out.
- **Diagnostics:** one button creates a report to paste into a bug report. Passwords, usernames,
  tokens and the VOD signing secret are removed, and IP addresses are shortened.
- **Update notice:** set a public GitHub `owner/repo` under **Update repository** and the page checks
  its latest release (cached for six hours). Leave it empty to hide the notice.

**Arabic interface**

Choose **Automatic**, **English** or **العربية** under **Interface language**. Arabic makes the
dashboard and the home page tab right-to-left and translates the interface. Channel names, group
names, film titles and other values are never translated. The dashboard setting is passed to the tab;
**Automatic** follows each browser's language. See also [README.ar.md](README.ar.md).

**Reliability**

- The PROTV client retries transient network errors and re-authenticates once when a token expires.
- If a refresh fails, the tab keeps the last channel list and shows a short "PROTV is unavailable"
  banner instead of an empty page.
- A failed channel health check never blocks playback; it only adds a visual warning.

## Recording

Jellyfin's DVR uses the same Live TV tuner and stream path as playback. Use **Dashboard > Live TV >
Recordings** (or the record button in the guide) normally. Notes for multicast sources:

- The server joins the multicast group for each recording, just as it does for playback, so one
  recording does not use up a "tuner" for other viewers.
- A recording is only as good as the multicast path. If the server cannot receive the group, both
  playback and recording fail; check the health page and the **Multicast network interface** setting.
- Jellyfin records to its own recording folder and transcodes when the client requests it. Make sure
  that folder has enough space, especially for series recordings.
- Recording support has not been tested on every Jellyfin client. If a recording starts but stays
  empty, check the Jellyfin log for the tuner and try a single recording before scheduling a series.

## Settings that are not on the dashboard

Most settings are on the PROTV dashboard. These remain in
`<config>/plugins/configurations/PROTV.Plugin.xml`; edit it while Jellyfin is stopped.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RequireCompanionPlugins` | `true` | Switch PROTV off when a companion plugin is missing. |
| `VodRemoveDeletedTitles` | `true` | Remove titles PROTV no longer lists after a complete sync. |
| `VodStreamSecret` | (generated) | Secret that signs the VOD links. Encrypted with the same server-local key and never included in backups. |
| `StreamAnalyzeDurationMs` | `1500` | Lower starts playback faster; too low can miss audio tracks. `0` = Jellyfin default. |

## Security and secrets

- **The PROTV password and the VOD signing secret are encrypted** with AES-GCM before Jellyfin writes
  `PROTV.Plugin.xml`. The random key lives in `<data>/protv/secret.key`, outside the plugin
  configuration folder. This keeps them out of screenshots, casual config copies and backups that
  only contain the XML; it is **not** protection against someone who can read the whole Jellyfin data
  folder.
- Values written by an older build are migrated to the encrypted form on the first start. If the
  server cannot create `secret.key`, the dashboard shows a warning and saving settings fails rather
  than writing the password or signing secret in clear text.
- Losing `secret.key` makes the saved password unreadable. Re-enter it on the dashboard; do not copy
  only the XML to another server and expect the password to work.
- The **parental PIN** is stored as a salted PBKDF2-SHA256 hash in `<data>/protv/parental.json`,
  never in the plugin XML. Unlock tokens are HMAC-signed, bound to one Jellyfin user, sent in the
  `X-PROTV-Unlock` header rather than a URL, and expire after twelve hours.
- Diagnostics remove the password, username, tokens and `VodStreamSecret` before showing a report,
  and shorten IP addresses. **Still read a report before posting it.**
- Settings backups leave out the password, the stream-signing secret and the parental PIN.
- `PROTV.Plugin.xml` and `secret.key` are still sensitive. Never post either, even though the secrets
  inside the XML are encrypted.
- The plugin never writes PROTV credentials, Jellyfin tokens or signed stream URLs to the log.

## What the plugin modifies

- Its own settings file `plugins/configurations/PROTV.Plugin.xml` (password encrypted; other secrets
  as described above), the encryption key in `<data>/protv/secret.key` and the parental PIN file in
  `<data>/protv/parental.json`.
- The Custom Tabs configuration (it adds, updates and removes its own tab) and the Plugin Pages entry.
- Live TV: it adds a tuner and a guide provider. Uninstalling from the dashboard removes them from your
  Live TV settings and queues a guide refresh, which can remove the PROTV channels from your library.
- The VOD libraries and the `protv-vod` folder (it creates and, for titles PROTV removed, deletes files there).

## Troubleshooting

1. Open the PROTV page, press **Create diagnostic report** and read it. It lists versions, companion
   plugin status, settings (without secrets), the VOD state and recent warnings.
2. **Test connection** tells you whether the login and the network path work.
3. Nothing happens after installing: look for `PROTV companion plugins` in the Jellyfin log.
4. PROTV disabled itself and the page is gone: install the missing plugins and restart, or stop Jellyfin
   and set `RequireCompanionPlugins` to `false`.
5. The tab says PROTV is unavailable: the last channel list is still usable; press **Refresh** when the
   service returns. Check the Jellyfin log for the HTTP status.
6. Channels listed but no picture: check the **Channel health** section, then make sure multicast reaches
   the server (`tcpdump -i <interface> udp port 1234`) and that Docker uses host networking.
7. A channel is greyed out: the health check could not get data for it. It may still play; the check is
   advisory and runs again every six hours.
8. Films have no genres: run the VOD sync once after updating. The sync only fetches categories when a
   title's NFO is missing a `<genre>`; if PROTV's detail endpoint returns none, the title stays without
   genres and the next sync tries again.
9. Old VOD items stop playing after an update: run **Sync PROTV VOD library** once.
10. The saved password stopped working after moving servers: enter it again; the encryption key did not
    move with the XML.

**Never post your password, `PROTV.Plugin.xml` or `secret.key`.** For security problems see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Known limitations

- Early development: expect bugs and changes between versions.
- Works in Syria only and only with a valid PROTV subscription.
- Multicast does not work over Docker's bridge network and is unreliable over Wi-Fi.
- The parental lock is enforced by the PROTV tab, not by Jellyfin's Live TV endpoints. Use Jellyfin's
  per-user Live TV permissions when you need a hard access control. Per-user ratings are not
  implemented; locks are per channel and the PIN is shared by the server.
- Changes to the home page tab settings or the sidebar label need a Jellyfin restart.
- Deleting the plugin folder by hand does not run the uninstall cleanup: remove the PROTV tuner under
  Live TV and run **Refresh Guide** yourself.
- Arabic translation covers the interface; channel, group and programme names are values and stay as
  PROTV wrote them.
- Recording is provided through Jellyfin's normal DVR path and has not been tested on every client.
- Only tested on Jellyfin 12.x.

## Building from source

```
dotnet build -c Release
```

The output is `bin/Release/net10.0/PROTV.Plugin.dll`. The project targets .NET 10 and the Jellyfin
12.0.0 packages. `make-release.ps1` builds the release zip and fills in `manifest.json`.

The pure-logic tests are an xunit project in `tests/PROTV.Plugin.Tests`:

```
dotnet test tests/PROTV.Plugin.Tests/PROTV.Plugin.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

They cover channel sorting and overrides, password encryption, parental PIN hashing and token signing,
version/repository parsing, EPG parsing and server-offset conversion, VOD sweep safeguards and genre
preservation, and the live-stream contracts.

## Releasing

Tag a version and GitHub Actions does the rest:

```
git tag v0.8.0
git push origin v0.8.0
```

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the plugin with the tag as its version (the version Jellyfin
shows comes from `PROTV.Plugin.csproj`), packs `PROTV_<version>.zip` holding `PROTV.Plugin.dll`,
publishes it as a GitHub release, and writes the release's MD5 into `manifest.json` so a plugin
catalog can offer the update. `.github/workflows/build.yml` compiles every push and pull request and
runs the tests in `tests/`.

To do the same by hand on Windows, run `.\make-release.ps1 -GitHubUser <you> -Repo <repo> -Version 0.8.0`
and upload the zip it prints.
